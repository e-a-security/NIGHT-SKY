"NIGHT SKY"

How it was built:
17 curves (Bézier curves) 
3 elements per curve
17 x 3 = 51 total characters

Elements:
Ordering 
External Circle radius minus Internal Circle radius to provide ordering.
Dot
Dot that connects to the ‘Ordering’ element
Tangent Point
Using the Bézier Curve Algorithm, a tangent point has been constructed per curve.

Two invisible ASCII grids (Red and Blue)
Each curve:
‘Ordering’ and ‘Dot’ are always on the same grid.
‘Tangent Point’ is always on the opposite grid.
Example: -      If ‘Ordering’ and ‘Dot’ are represented on the Blue grid. ‘Tangent Point’ is represented on the Red grid.
-      If ‘Ordering’ and ‘Dot’ are represented on the Red grid. ‘Tangent Point’ is represented on the Blue grid.
